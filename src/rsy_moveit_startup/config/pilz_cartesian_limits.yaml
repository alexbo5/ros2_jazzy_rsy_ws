# Cartesian Limits for Pilz Industrial Motion Planner
# Applied to LIN (linear) and CIRC (circular) motions
#
# These limits ensure smooth, controlled Cartesian motion
# Adjust based on your application requirements

cartesian_limits:
  # Maximum translational velocity (m/s)
  # UR3/UR3e can handle higher, but keep conservative for precision work
  max_trans_vel: 0.01

  # Maximum translational acceleration (m/s^2)
  max_trans_acc: 1.5

  # Maximum translational deceleration (m/s^2, typically negative of acceleration)
  max_trans_dec: -1.5

  # Maximum rotational velocity (rad/s)
  # ~57 deg/s - smooth rotation
  max_rot_vel: 1.0
