# Kinematics Configuration for UR Robots
# Uses TRAC-IK for robust inverse kinematics with shortest-path optimization
#
# TRAC-IK solve types:
#   Speed    - fastest solution, may not be optimal
#   Distance - minimizes joint movement from seed (prevents spinning)
#   Manip1/2 - maximizes manipulability
#
# Using "Distance" to ensure robot takes shortest path to target
